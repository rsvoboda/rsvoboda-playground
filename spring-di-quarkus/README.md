# Converting existing Spring DI code to use Quarkus

I was playing a bit with Spring DI and Quarkus before Christmas. I took repo referenced from baeldung.com site, trimmed the code and pom.xml to use just di.spring package. After the trimming I tried to migrate source code to use quarkus-spring and then I tried to migrate tests.

Code is here: https://github.com/rsvoboda/tutorials/commits/experiments
