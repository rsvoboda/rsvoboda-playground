# How to run macOS quarantined apps / downloaded from internet

MacOS Big Sur is apparently more restrictive when it comes to applications downloaded from internet.
"Appname.app is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You should move it to the Trash." is shown with just `Cancel` and `Move to Trash` options.

This command removes the attributes which prevent execution of graalvm-ce-java11-20.3.0:
```
sudo xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/graalvm-ce-java11-20.3.0/
```
